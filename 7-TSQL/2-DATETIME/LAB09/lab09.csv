1905043;2010-01-01 06:56:01.377;1987356;0;Yes. Typically, each `+` operator involves the overhad of creating a new temporary `StringBuilder` object, initializing it with the partially built string, appending the next character, which typically causes the internal buffer array in `StringBuilder` to be reallocated and copied (again). And this happens for each loop iteration. So, yeah, it's generally a very slow way to do it. Using an explicit `StringBuilder` having a sufficiently large buffer allocated to it eliminates all of that overhead.;170383

What's also a bit weird is that even reading from numpy arrays, the python code is still faster. If it was call overhead, I'd expect that to be slowed down even more than the pure NumPy solution.;216420
1905154;2010-01-01 08:42:23.010;1988145;0;@Adam: but by reading from numpy's arrays you save the overhead of calling the `cross` function itself, which is a dynamically loaded extension so it goes through at least a couple of pointers. For such short arrays it indeed makes sense as a micro-optimization to unroll the call to `cross`;8206

When you use a session you access the objects in it with indexers and you need to cast the result. If you want to access typed data you have to create a class that accesses the session and returns the data. Usually a proxy design pattern is used to implement that class. This way you'll control what kind and type of objects you have in session.;236831

However it would still be nice as an added bonus to be able to reuse the function on other objects. Now regarding overloading, does `this.push || push` allow overloading by an intermediate class between this and Array? And, similar question, does `this.push.apply` allow overloading by an intermediate class? Finally, what is the benefit of the alternate version, wouldn't `this.push` always be faster than `this.push || push`?;228259

1905373;2010-01-01 11:48:32.527;1985471;0;Regarding the >>> operator, does it really improve performances considering that JS always converts back integers to double? This could result into length being converted to integer, shifted (not), then converted back to double, and finally used as a double later. This could decrease performances unless some JS implementation actually stores (unsigned) integers in variables. In which case one might think that such an implementation would store this.length as an integer and therefore >>> 0 would not improve anything. Also this.length would already be unsigned.;228259

The problem is that OOM happens at runtime on the user's machine. You have no control over memory sizes in these machines and over the HD space for the swap file. Then add memory leaks to it... Plus, it is quite easy to test that your app can handle it. Use a wrapper for malloc/realloc that randomly returns NULL.;153617
